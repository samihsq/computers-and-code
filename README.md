# computers-and-code


The purpose of this repository is to help people understand computers and code better.

## Learning Computer Science and Languages

### Computer Science

[Here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/) are some really useful Khan Academy tutorials on computer science.


### Python
A great starting language due to its simplicity.

_Resources:_

* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp): a free, online tutorial on python

* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python): a crash course on python

_Projects:_

* [Hello World](https://github.com/samihsq/computers-and-code/blob/master/python/helloworld.py): a simple hello world program in python

### Java

_Resources:_

* [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/); this tutorial really helped me understand Java (it helps if you buy the tutorial when it is on sale, which happens a lot)

_Projects:_

* A simple hello world program in Java. 

[_Source Code_](https://github.com/samihsq/computers-and-code/blob/master/java/src/helloworld.java)  
[_Code Running_](http://tpcg.io/VbOMwR) (press execute)
 

### R

_Resources:_

_Projects:_

* [Hello World](https://github.com/samihsq/computers-and-code/blob/master/r/helloworld.R): a simple hello world program in R


* 401K9: one of my projects; a map of some known K9s in California and a table that shows if they have retired.  
[_Source Code_](https://github.com/samihsq/401k9)  
[_Working Model_](http://138.68.62.139:3838/)

## Robotics

_Resources:_

_Projects:_

## Drones

_Resources:_

* [Crazyflie](https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyflie-2/): a tiny drone that can be programmed or controlled (with a controller)

_Projects:_


## IOT (Internet of Things)

_Resources:_

* [An explanation on what IOT is](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/what-is-the-iot/)

_Projects:_

[Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge): a way to connect non-compatible HomeKit IOT devices with the Home app in iOS. I use it at home and it works great. 



## My Projects

[Here](https://github.com/samihsq/401k9) is a link to one of my projects; a map of some known K9s in California and a table that shows if they have retired. This project is named 401K9 and it is coded in R.
