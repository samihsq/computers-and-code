# computers-and-code


The purpose of this repository is to help people understand computers and code better.

## Learning Computer Science and Languages

### Computer Science

[Here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/) are some really useful Khan Academy tutorials on computer science.


### Python
A great starting language due to its simplicity.

_Resources:_

* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp): a free, online tutorial on python

* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python): a crash course on python

_Projects:_

### Java

_Resources:_

* [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/); this tutorial really helped me understand Java (it helps if you buy the tutorial when it is on sale, which happens a lot)

_Projects:_

### R

_Resources:_

_Projects:_

* 401K9: one of my projects; a map of some known K9s in California and a table that shows if they have retired.

## My Projects

[Here](https://github.com/samihsq/401k9) is a link to one of my projects; a map of some known K9s in California and a table that shows if they have retired. This project is named 401K9 and it is coded in R.
